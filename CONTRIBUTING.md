# Contributing
## GitHub
As it currently stands, GitHub is just the upstream server for public consumption of my code. Any commits to this central repository will be over written on the next sync from my GitLab server.
## GitLab
The latest development branch, which should include bug fixes and new features, can be found on my personal GitLab server at the link below.

### master
This branch has the latest tested code base, and will be what release files are built off of
### develop
This branch should have the latest, mostly working code. If a merge request to this branch fails initial QA, it will be reverted
